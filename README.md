# opengovernment
Open Government theme developed for Involve/UK Open Government Network

Please note that this theme assumes the availability of the following plugins (some premium):

- Advanced Custom Fields Pro
- Breadcrumb NavXT
- Custom Post Type UI (though the custom post types are handled in functions.php for the most part)
- WP Page Navi

We'd also recommend Akismet, WP Super Cache and a security plugin such as iThemes Security.
