# opengovernment
This is the WordPress theme for the website of
the Australian Open Government Partnership Network.

It is a fork of
[the Open Government theme](https://github.com/helpful/opengovernment)
developed for Involve/UK Open Government Network

Please note that this theme assumes the availability of the following plugins (some premium):

- [Advanced Custom Fields Pro](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/)
- [Breadcrumb NavXT](https://wordpress.org/plugins/breadcrumb-navxt/)
- [Custom Post Type UI](https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-post-type-ui/) (though the custom post types are handled in functions.php for the most part)
- [WP Page Navi](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-pagenavi/)

We'd also recommend Akismet, WP Super Cache and a security plugin such as iThemes Security.
